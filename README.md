# blog
A simple meteor blog based on [ryw:blog](https://github.com/Differential/meteor-blog)

## Why?
We want to have a blog integrated with our already integrated meteor webapp, 
use the existing logins. 

### Integration with Emergence
We want to integrate blogging as an integral part of doing science.
Blogging can be used to give quick updates on current research results. It can be 
seen as a lightweight freestyle open scientific publication. Relationship connections
between blog post can be seen as a post-peer-review workflow. The Disqus commenting
system as quick feedbacks. Blogs become then an integral part of disseminating 
research. 

## Roadmap
